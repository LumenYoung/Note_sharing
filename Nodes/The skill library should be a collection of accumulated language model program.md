Given some primitive APIs, the skill library should be a set of accumulated language model program.

Since LLMs can understand and write codes. It is suitable to make the skill set also in form of codes.

Like the header file in cpp, the language agent **looks at function decleration line and docstring** for choosing between actions.

As part of the reflexion, the function to **modify other functions** when experiencing conflict or unsuccessful execution should also be available. Additionally, it is possible for the robot to creat more fine-grain control premitive when they got the ability see the whole function and modify it for their need.
