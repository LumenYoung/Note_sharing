Such heuristic could also be helpful for [[Language agent|language agent]]. It takes place in two fold.

Firstly, LLM can already provide versatile heuristic for most of the tasks, to some degree, most of the knowledge captured by LLM are all availability heuristics as they are not directly associated with the end goal rather randomly popped up given their context.

Besides, when you employ a **skill library** additional to the LLM, like voyager as a language agent, heuristic based on the frequency of accessing a knowledge could be a simple approximation of availability heuristic.
