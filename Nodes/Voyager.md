Voyager, proposed in the paper *Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models*, is an automatic agent in the Minecraft simulation environment.

The system is made of three components. [[An automatic currculum for open-ended exploration]], an iterative prompting scheme for processing and a growing skill library for dynamically available action space.

Minecraft as a simulator can provide **semantically rich environment feedback**, which is not directly available in the real world cases.
